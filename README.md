# react-techs
Work in progress, not finished yet.
Started building on 6th August 2022

To gain my comprehension of React, AWS, Algorithms, and other technologies, I have created this repository. I am currently working on a project to build a web application that explains some of the technologies I use. The explanation will contain some quizzes to test users.
But for now, I will be posting my submissions for LeetCode problems. (Thus no quizzes)
